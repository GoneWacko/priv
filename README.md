# priv

`priv` is a simple tool for creating, mounting, unmounting and removing private storages inside LUKS-encryped files.

The tool uses plain files on the file system which it formats and opens as an ext4 file system inside a LUKS-device.

It's very simple, and there are a lot more full-featured and better solutions out there...
